You'll find that there is a climate that is favorable for the life of a human being, however, should there be extreme heat, there is nothing that can survive in this world. We see countries abroad where whenever there is extreme heat prevails even for only three months, everything dies beyond salvage. Therefore I think that extreme heat can be a disastrous thing should it happen. It would mean that we forsake farming, we forsake rearing of animals. Ourselves, where will you run for help? That's why I'm saying that if it is to happen then it would be the end of us because everything we help ourselves with comes from the soil. These things come from the soil because they need water, however, how would you farm if there's such drought?

The difference is seen when sometimes there is too much rainfall and sometimes there is drought. If in the past days, a lot of rainfall is experienced and and today there is drought, then I can describe that as climate change. So climate change is when there is a change in the weather patterns from the yesterday and today. We saw climate changing to a point where we cannot predict whether we can have a good or bad harvest. We can experience heavy rains then at the end there is drought and very high temperatures. So we cannot predict how our crops will do if we plant. For the crops to do well, they need at least three months of predictable weather pattern. With the constant weather changes between high rainfall and drought the crops cannot do well. Rainfall is required during planting and weeding and sunshine during harvesting. With the weather changes, we experience sunshine when we need rain and rain when we need sunshine. That is where climate change affect farmers like myself.",Yes,"Results because of climate change? Should I mention the positive or the negative ? As a result of climate change, our land has died (become desolate). In some instances, climate change has triggered a lot of rainfall to the extent that one can imagine it will never rain again. It rains so much to the point it ruins our walking paths. Sometimes, it rains and floods.  So many people have migrated but some can't migrate because they don't have the finances to do so. That has been climate change. Some people's farms have been washed away by erosion including the very top soil that has humus that has gone with the rainwater. People are forced to farm in barren lands where no crop can produce yields in. Because they were not ready for climate change, it surprised them. They were not aware of it. Climate change has also brought about some new kinds of trees, trees that are not indigenous to this place. I think they have been transferred by the rain water. Even climate change has favoured these trees. Trees we have never seen before. There is a particular one that meanders on the ground and is very thorny. It's a tree that wasn't previously on our land. We can't tell where it is from. Maybe it was brought by moving water or climate change has allowed it to sprout and flourish here. Cows can't graze next to eat because it's very thorny. In fact, cows cannot even put their mouths on the ground if it's around. Climate change has driven us to hunger and we can't predict the climate. You can work really hard thinking that the climate will favour you but eventually, it switches to unfavorable conditions that can't allow our seeds to grow. This has made our farm fields go to waste because we had planted early hoping that the climate would favour what people had planted. Unfortunately, it turned out differently and there are no grains. Some people had tilled, some had planted, and farm fields have gone unplanted because things did not turn out as expected. So that is how climate change has hurt us in another way as per our discussion today.",No,,,,Neighbour,Yes,Building terraces,No,,Neighbour,Yes,Use water,Other,Erosion.,30,1000000,"School,Health Centre,Financial Service (e.g. M-Pesa agent; bank)","['Walking ', 'Walking ', 'Walking ']","['45', '60', '60']","['Very Hard', 'Very Hard', 'Very Hard']",Mobile phone,Social events  ,Internet search,2-3 times week,Every day,Every day,2-3 times week,Very connected,One should trust but needs to be careful,Self-help group.

Climate change has resulted in low farm yields. This is so because farmers were waiting for the rainfall season and by the time they start planting, the season is already over. So germination of crops is affected hence low yields. Instead of a farmer getting ten bags they get only three to four bags. So that's what has brought about a change and hunger in the community.

That is bad.

We need rain during planting and weeding, and after that even if it stops raining, the crops will still do well. So at times after planting, just before you finish weeding, it stops raining, which affects the crops, by making them stagnant instead of continuing to grow. This affects farming in that when it was supposed to rain, it does not rain, and thereby the harvest will not be so good, and what was expected to be harvested cannot be achieved. We usually use DAP when planting, however, when it stops raining when you are using DAP, you will have a poor harvest. When the harvest is poor, the price in the market will be higher, yet people don't have money. So when it is at a higher price, other people who cannot afford to buy the maize will be forced to eat other types of food which might not have a balanced diet.  Some people might eat ugali after a week because of lacking money, and others might be forced to take sweet potatoes which are full of starch, and you, therefore, find our bodies lacking essential vitamins. You will find even if someone has money, he/she will buy the maize at a higher price, and not buy other basic needs like clothes, and even at times he/she might leave education aside because food becomes a priority. A lot of money will be used on food, thereby creating an imbalance.","Corrugated Iron Sheet,Clothes,Irrigation","Climate change is the change in rainy seasons. Such that we used to have a rainy season, one for short rains and one for long rains. But there has been a change in climate and the seasons we knew to be for long and short rains have changed. Now the long rainy season which we knew to have a lot of rain, has changed and now the season has little rain now because of the change in the climate. So the things that we had previously planted during the long rains, can no longer be planted because the rains as we were used to, have become less. So things have changed. The season that we knew to have short and little rain, has become the season where we can now start planting. Another thing is that climate change has led to poor harvests. You find that there is so little rain that the grass that cows usually feed on is scarce. But previously, we could predict the weather and we would know the season of long rains would bring a lot of grass for grazing and we were not worried. Right now, you can't reserve land because the place you imagine you will till, you will end up finding out that the rains will not be enough for any harvest.

We usually use DAP and CAN to increase the yield of our crops, but their prices skyrocketed, and we still went ahead and bought them at that high price and planted our crops, but then it stopped raining. So the whole community experienced loss, even though people are yet to harvest, you can just see that there is hunger already even if you walk around. Maize which people were relying on, will flower at the height that it has currently reached. We don't have hope that we will harvest anything for sure, and that has affected the community.

For example, the rainy season at the start of the year which is called 'chiri' (long rains), lately has low volume rainfall despite being the season that previously had more rainfall. As opposed to these days, during short rains called 'opon' when the rainfall volumes were traditionally lower, now experience the highest rainfall volumes. These days we have wet Christmas all the way to February which should not be the case. You will find that people and things have really changed in our village because of climate change. The foods that we use to depend on like maize, sweet potatoes, cassava, sorghum are nowadays scarce given the scarcity of rainfall. You'll find that the focus has shifted to trees.

Yes, power saw. Destroys. And that is why you find that some of the causes of climate change are due to cutting down trees with no alternative of replanting trees because a power saw can bring down a lot of trees within a very short time. That is part of the destruction.

Everything dries up in the farm .You will discover things like vegetables are scarce and to have them you have to pay a lot of money for their acquisition. So you are forced to buy a small portion. If you have no money then you will not be able to make a purchase at all. The cost of life has gone up. There are things that we grew but unfortunately they dried up and so there is no food. If you have cows then you also have to pay for their fodder, all that is an extra cost incurred.","Money,House,Borehole","There is a big change, in the way I am seeing this climate compared to years back, the land used to be fertile but nowadays it is not, if you fail to use fertilizer on your farm then you get a poor harvest. At times also the rains fail to come, and when they come the crops have already failed and this really affects us. Heat has also increased here, in the past, it was never this hot, now you find that it is too hot compared to the previous year, even when I used to be a kid it used to be very cool unlike nowadays. Some weeds have also appeared and we don't know where they have come from, and they are the ones that are now many, and even finding grass is now difficult. They just look like shrubs and they are now many, and our cows can't even feed on them, they are things that don't help us, and they are many on our farms. There are also many worms in our farms such as the fall armyworm, which are destroying maize. There is something called kayongo which has invaded our farms, this kayongo is affecting maize, once it attacks a maize stem, the maize stops growing. It never used to be here but now it is here. Some diseases of banana trees have also appeared, you find that a banana tree grows well, and as soon as it starts fruiting, all the fruits rot, and I think climate change is still responsible for this. Cassavas have also been affected by some diseases, you find the cassava rotting and we don't really know the cause, but I think it is still climate change. In the past, we used to get very big cassava, but nowadays they are small until you can cook them without cutting them into smaller pieces unlike in the past. Nowadays you just have to peel the cassava and cook it because they are too small, and that is the effect of climate change in our surrounding. Another issue is soil erosion, flooding takes away the fertile top soil leaving behind soil that is not fertile which cannot grow crops well, so if you don't use fertilizer there is nothing that you can get from the farm. In the past, we also used to have a lot of streams, but they all dried, and people used to grow sugarcane in those areas, but now you can't grow sugarcane. There are just specific areas where there is a lot of water, but areas that used to grow sugarcane in the past like Odundo nowadays don't grow them. Even if you want to grow Napier grass, it requires where there is water, but getting water is difficult, they all dried up. Trees that used to grow in the past are also not available nowadays.",Yes,"In the olden days, people used to keep large heards of cattle. The cows were fat, big and so many. Right now, people have no enough pasture to feed the cows. Animal feeds are not there in the first place. So, it forces people to keep a small number of cows yet still there is no enough pastures for them. It is really different from the past. In the past, milky was there in plenty but nowadays even if you milked a cow, there is no milk in these cows. In the past a cow could produce even 3 jugs of milk, nowadays even a glass does not get filled up. 
Food was plenty in the past. Nowadays food is scarce. Those crops that people used to grow like cassavas, sweet potatoes and such like crops nolonger exists. Only a few people still grow them and still they do not do good like they used to. So, food is scarce. These are a lot of changes already. 
In the past, if yu happen to go to someone's place you would eat a lot of boiled maize nad beans and still leave more there but nowadays food is meaured using spoons. People literally have no food. People are not eating as they used to. There was plenty of water. There was water in all these rivers but now they have since dried up. Nowadays people rely on rains to rain so as to tap rainwater. If that is not the case then you have to find water in the taps. Water in those taps are not free, you have to buy.

Whenever there is drought, there is nothing that can do well in the farming sector. With the onset of drought, there is hardly a thing you can do when it comes to farming. Unless there is rainfall, you cannot be able to grow your vegetables or crops. Every time we experience drought, we lack what to eat and even the domestic animals like cattle could be faced out. Even the human being himself can really suffer in the face of drought. Water has to be available for survival. Whenever there is drought, it occasions a very hard lifestyle for people. Drought destroys the world and that is why I would say that I worry about it. I would also say that life becomes very difficult whenever there is drought because people cannot plant crops. Whatever is eaten these days mostly comes from the farms, and therefore, when rainfall does not come, there is nothing that can come from those farms. That situation then forces one to spend from your pocket whenever you need any farm produce. Unfortunately, prices of farm produce shoot up grounded on the scarcity being experienced during drought. That is because one person might have something but most people do not, and as such, driving the demand high. Drought makes life very expensive and therefore, it is not a good thing.","House,Clothes,Borehole","As per our area, I can say that the way the weather looks right now has changed.

So you can find that you can miss the sunny period from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock and when nighttime falls, it starts to rain. The climate has really changed now, long ago it used to rain in January. From January that's when it used to rain. That's when it used to rain. Nowadays, it rains whenever it feels like it. So that's why the climate has really changed.",No,"Okay, what has changed? In the climate of past, it was said that during the sunny season, rainfall was scarce. But in this presence, sunny seasons experience so much rain than before. And that is why there is a big difference now. In the past, rainy seasons had more rainfall but currently, it is the sunny seasons which experience much more rainfall. Yes, What is there? What it has brought? The change it has brought? Is that right now you can find some crops not doing well but pawpaws ripen so better that you find someone who goes to the farm comes back feeling happy and laughing all the way up. Depending the change it has brought, I can say people who planted late times are the ones whose crops did not do well and those who planted local indegenious  seeds. Contrary, people who planted hybrid seeds from the stores are the ones who enjoy this time as crops are doing on well. So it has brought so much change.

We are even forced now to go and lease farms outside, but even after leasing the harvest still fails. Last year, I did not plant because the previous year I had leased two acres of land, I used a lot of money and I even used my child's school fees in the hope that the harvest will be good and I will be able to repay back the money, but I only got one sack of maize from the two farms and I gave up because even people who don't farm still eat.

The change of climate has also affected our income in that you find maybe somebody who wanted you to go and plough for him/her telling you that ""let us wait until the time rain will come"".

Because people used to farm while knowing what the output would be. They did their own timing knowing that the timing would bring a good harvest. Then it fails to rain, and there is no harvest. Then you find that it rains in the months when it's not supposed to rain. Now it's such that people can't plant maize, now people have to go back to planting vegetables.

So it used to rain occasionally, but nowadays it is too much and there is a difference, and life has also become problematic. I can also add that the population of people living around has increased, people are congested such that there is nowhere to farm, and you can only get a small space to farm that if your harvest is good you can only get three bags.

The moment we got out and ran to the scene, opened the door to free him, the roof of the house caved in under the strength of the fire. 
We suspect there was someone outside who lit the fire. The fire razed everything that was in that house including his school uniforms that the only clothes he had left were those on his back. I felt so bad. We looked for policemen who came and arrested the man we suspected to have organized the arson attack.

I desire to rear chickens, but this house is too small, so there is no way I can keep chickens. The help I desire to receive is the help to extend this house so that it becomes big. If the house is big, whenever I have guests, they will have somewhere to help themselves. That is my biggest desire, but times are hard economically, and I injured my hands building this house. I am happy with this house but am not that happy because it is small. It is so congested, so I need to extend it to be at least a bigger house than this. These are the ambitions I have for this house. So if there is any help I can receive, I will ensure it is used very well. Secondly, where we stay is semi-permanent, this house is semi-permanent.

Secondly people loose motivation for growing crops because they feel like even if they grow crops then they will get destroyed by the extreme heat and so I would not be able to get yields. This is quite worse as compared to an earthquake because an earthquake can occur but still it can rain. But for this situation where It is always just sunny none stop and a person cannot be able to plant anything, I feel worried.  Also the extreme heat  affects the livestock because when you do not farm, you lack green pastures to feed them, the vegetation also is dry and so livestock is forced to survive on water alone. This is really affecting our animals.  When there is no rain you will the animals just licking the soil because there is nothing to feed on. So when there is no rain we are really affected because even the farm produce decreases and becomes less.
Thirdly it makes people lack the incentive to practice crop and animal farming. In the past when there was rain people could even farm prior to the planting season. Because of the extreme heat soil looses its moisture and the minerals get leached and so the soil becomes infertile.","House,Money,Motorcycle","Climate chnage is the changes of the weather patterns that happen in the atmosphere. You find that in the past like here at our place, we have one planting season. By the time wwe are planting, we plant once. When the change of climate had not occurred, here in our comunity we used to adquate rainfall. The rains that used to rain could support the one planting season. We used to feel that indeed it has rained. But nowadays, when there are rains, people can start preparing their farms in the month of March and still wait upto to May for rains. When it finally rains, it does very shortly. So,  it is so inadequate that cannot make the plants to mature in this area that we live. That is one.
Two, we have short rainfalls, these short rainfalls comes because of climate change. The climate change also is caused by lack of not planting trees because in some days back, there were trees. People have resorted to do deforestation. They could cut tree to make charcoals. So, when people continued cutting trees and making charcoal even on the hills that used to attract rains for us. Here we believe that the hills and the lake are the ones that attracts the rains in this area. When the trees are cut the rains that we expect to rain fails to rain in the expected time. 
Thirdly, you can find that you have planted but it fails to rain completely. The sun shines through out. This therefore will results to low yield. In the end of farming, the farmer gets nothing from the farm because of inadequate rainfall and sun and ecetera. So, these are the situations that I am certain that they have been brought by climate change. You find that the rains that used to rain here, sometimes you see it in the clouds but it passes over to another area. You find that when it passes over this area, it rains in some other areas.
Another one is that sometimes we can stay for long without experiencing the rains. We stay for so long without seeing rains. So if someone wants to plant their vegetables and other crops apart from the main grains like maize, it becomes difficult because if you dont own a water pump or a generator you cannot farm even simple vegatables or even tomatoes because of the climate change. The climate change has affected us adversely because like for me , last year I planted and I did not harvest anything. The crops died in the fam because the rains failed to come. This is a big challenge to us. We have to continue buying foodstuffs because the rains are inadquate. I think so far, that is how I can explain how I understand in terms of Climate Change.",Yes,"The way people practice farming is one of the things that have changed as a result of climate change. People cannot till their lands or they cannot prepare their lands earlier the way they used to do it sometimes back. 
Secondly, you may prepare that land waiting for the rainy season, and since I said that the rain is inadequate, you may prepare your land, till your land and plant the seeds and when you are waiting for rainfall to fall, sometimes you may wait for that rainfall and you find yourself in a difficult situation where the rainfall will not be there and you have already used the money had in the preparation and planting and as such will hardly get back the money you invested in the farming at the end of the season. So these are some of the things that transpire these days. 
Secondly, the rains used to come early. Previously, people used to be aware of the fact that the long rains would come in March and because that happens no more, we are affected. The rains that people relied on for the planting season came during March. Unfortunately, these days we cannot plant in March. You will always find that these days people start land preparation in March and wait until the month of May to plant because that is where they expect the rains will fall. So these these things have really affected us. These are the things that have changed about our climate that never used to happen previously. 
The third thing that transpired back in the days but no longer is the case is the fact that the rains would fall for as long as two months non-stop. However, the rains, which by the way are intermittent, can come and fall only for about a month only, and subside significantly during the second month of rainfall when it should boost the crops for better yields. Therefore, these are some of the things we see now that never happened in the past because of climate change. 
Fourth, we used to prepare our lands during the month of December. In fact we would celebrate Christmas with our farms ready for the planting season early in the year. That preparation, however, does not happen these days. Nowadays people are disorganized for lack of knowledge and predictability of what will happen and when. As a result of that, some people will be late in their land preparations, some people will be on time while others might be too early. Some unlucky ones are also caught off guard by the rains before they are ready fro the planting season. These are the effects of the climate change that I see.

Also in our area when floods happen, crops get swept away by the floods. When floods occur people get such a hard time because even moving around is difficult.

You also find that when it is wet, even grasshoppers and any other thing thrive, so when it is dry there are a lot of negative things.

Even a way of finding that maize pulp is difficult because you planted seeds but the seeds died because of the sun. That has been the negative effect on my life and even the lives of this whole village. That has been a matter that has brought suffering to a point where children find it hard in their school matters. Because even a means of buying a book becomes hard. Finding money becomes hard because of the sun. Then the opportunity you get during the rainy season or even when the rain comes, that can bring help so that the things that have been planted can flourish, doesn't fall. You find again that it can rain so much that we have to move from our lands where we live because we like in a place that is not so good, in an area that is not so well and water floods. So this matter has made us suffer and you find that during the period where it wants to rain a lot until people think that we can get help, you find that the rain falls a lot and the help is no more. Even the things that you have planted, that water carries away. You are forced to start afresh after the rains, like people who have just come into the village from some other village. Those are the burdens and sufferings we go through because of climate change. Exactly.",Yes,"Climatic change has really affected us. First, most people living along the lake have lost their livestock due to drought. This is because, the cows in search of pasture along the lake shore, end up drowning. The goats die of starvation as they cannot follow the cows into the water. There is a lot of insecurity. Fishing is poor during the hot season and as this is the main occupation of the people on the lake shore, most people find themselves jobless hence they resort to crime. The crime rate has risen and we live in extreme fear. Thuggery is the order of the day and when the criminals strike, it doesn't matter whether you have what they want or not. Everyone is a victim and you can lose your life in the process. There is also a change in the weather patterns. Floods are common during the rainy season. The landscape makes this easy and we risk being swept away. Most times we have to leave our homes and seek shelter in schools. This is quite difficult because at times the school is in session and we inconvenience our children who want to learn and their teachers. It is unfortunate that the few livestock that survived the drought are swept away by the floods. We are therefore always desperate because of the unpredictable climatic change. Both the dry season and the rainy season are extreme hence we are left helpless.",Yes,1,May,Thank you. Flood as we had spoken in the previous session on the issue of climate change. Flood has affected my life badly because it had destroyed my house and I remained with nowhere to stay forcing me to go and seek shelter in school. Flood has also destroyed my plants until I remained with nothing. That issue forced me to start afresh with my family. It has not been an easy work to me.

The soil is the type that is easily weakened by wetness and therefore it falls down from the walls of my house whenever it rains because the walls were not plastered with cement. As a result of this challenge of weak walls, I have to keep repairing my house by replacing the mud in the destroyed areas after every few episodes of rainfall. 
Additionally, the corrugated iron sheets that were used in making the roof have since grown old under the rust and are leaking. The dilapidated state of my roof forces me to migrate my belongings in the house from other sections to better sections every time it rains. Therefore I do not live a decent life because I lack a good house, I do not like this house.

That is why our environment and climatic conditions are not favorable that if I were to find an alternative place, I would really appreciate because nothing good seems to happen for us here. The situation is often so bad that farming is more often than not a futile exercise.  This weather condition has destroyed many of my things.

We planted crops last season in time but it is unfortunate that drought came shortly after and destroyed all the crops and therefore had nothing to harvest. Last year we also prepared our farms and planted crops but the rains came and again destroyed everything. The crops were swept away by flood waters and everything ended up in the lake. Where my home is was also totally submerged in the flood waters as the lake broke its banks. As a result of the flooding, I had to migrate to seek refuge in other people's homes which are located on higher grounds. I could not live here for some time. Frankly speaking you would be shocked if you came here in the month of April, we live in a flood prone area and whenever the long rains come, flood water comes from this end and sweeps everything with it into the lake.

They steal even chicken, the chicken you are rearing. You can not own something because there is no money, and there is no work that those youths are doing. So what there get is what they will steal. After stealing they left you with nothing so this village is not safe because these children have no work. We don't have maize, our income is also low so all of these bring us problems because they don't know how they will start. So that is the hardship we are experiencing in this community.",Yes,2,April,"We have an outbreak of mosquitos  during floods. During this period, we have malaria and other diseases.

Drought causes a lack of food, it causes hunger, and if you grow something they do not do well. When there is drought and you grow vegetables within the homestead or tomatoes outside the homestead and it's a land which is not close to a river, then the tomatoes may not do well, you will have to water the plants yourself every morning and evening. Farming also becomes hard because of a lack of motivation, the soil is dry and hard, the sun is hot, and you end up doing very little farming and heading back home.","Rainwater Harvesting System,Solar PV System,Motorcycle","The world has changed a lot to the worse not good. You know in the past, the popoulation was low in the whole world, right now the population is high. All this population is competiting for few resources available including where to build their houses. So they cut down trees. So, if we can plant more trees, or use other methods or when you cut a tree, you plant more. People have been affected because of cutting down of trees because once there are no trees or the forest cover is less, then the weather changes. Climate patterns mostly depend on the trees. The best climate is rain though we still need the sun. But when you look keenly those places that it has been shining for the last four years and those that have been receiving little rains now and again, you will agree that rains are the best. Those places that have attracted rains if you observe well  they have trees. So, it is the trees that affects climate. That is why i am not happy about our place, there are no trees. It should be that when one cuts down some treesthen they should read to plant others. If you cut one,  you should plant three.",Yes,"Something that has changed is the season of planting or harvesting because we plant crops in a year. The one for long rain and short rain. We have the ones we begin ploughing in January to February and we plant the crops in March. We have another one that we plough in August and we harvest the ones you are seeing we can harvest. So find sometimes crops are affected by the sun and they don't do well, that is the most effect we have identified. When there is a lot of sun even if the crops are fertile they just get destroyed and wither. That is what I am thinking has been affecting crops, even in this season crops have not done well because, in the recent past, it has been raining, and later the sun came which makes the crops not do well. It has mostly affected crops, you know when there is a lot of sun chickens always get affected by many diseases. It affects chicken. When it is raining it becomes better, and there is wind so you know the diseases that affect chicken always circulates in the air.

During the dry season, people just prepare their lands and wait for the rainy season to commence before they can plant maize. When it begins to rain, you can plant vegetables and beans but it depends on how much rain there is. One has to be keen on the appropriate time to plant so as to get good harvest. This is how it was done in the past and even today. Climate change affects us greatly. When there is too much rain we cannot plant because the sandy soil will be washed away. We also cannot plant when it is dry because the soil is too hard, moderate rainfall is the best time for planting. We have to be keen on the rain pattern before planting.

So when the plants dries up it forces him to look for another option. When it rains there is a lot of hustle ,you can go plough for someone and get money to pay your Childs tuition. But when there is drought you can't go plough for someone, there are some people who plants trees to make a forest, and can cut some down and take them to school for his child's education. But when he goes back to plant some cant grow back or even can't grow tall. When its really shining ,it shines even where people resides and there is no way someone can make money or even sell something. Some people go for poultry farming ,and when there is a lot of sunshine a lot deaths in poultry farming because poultry feed on worms so it forces use to multivitamins.

As a result of their disobedience, man was condemned to pain when giving birth and having to sweat and toil for his food. Therefore these were consequences of going against the will of God.
The things we see happening now are also because the world is nearing its end. There is nothing that remains of this world. Therefore these are some of the things that God uses to punish the human race for its sins.

Thus once it has passed by it leaves with everything and forces you to start afresh. Which means the rivers have over filled the banks and it flows with so much force and in different tides. As for the extreme sun heat, we can plant more trees that can control the heat.",,"About climate change, I would say that first of all a long time ago during the 70s and the 80s, we could farm and plant our crops without using the fertilizers and we still realized good crop yields. However that is not the case these days as you have to have some artificial fertilizer manufactured by the white man for you to get some harvest from the farms. 
Also, the large human population ahs also led to deforestation. It is possible to find that someone will fell down five trees at a go and fail to plant even one as replacement and that has changed a lot of things in the atmosphere. The results of such wanton cutting down down of trees has even affected the quality of the air we breath because it has been compromised. 
Additionally if we reflect back, we could use our energy to till the land ourselves and do everything else without machines but that has since changed as well, we no longer have the energy to do that and the soils have also become harder for our bare strengths. It is for that reason that these days people will resort to using tractors to plough and plant using artificial farm inputs. It would be interesting to note that just a few years back, farming was not a difficult task provided we had food to give us energy and cow dung to be used as fertilizer for the crops. 
These days the human farmer population has also become selective in what they grow as food crops. Most farmers in this area have focused on maize and neglected the farming of sorghum, sweet potatoes and cassavas. Noteworthy, someone who feeds on ugali prepared with a mixture of sorghum, maize and cassava will have better health outcomes and strength compared to one who does not. If subjected to tests by the doctor, the person who feeds in a well balanced diet containing the aforementioned grain combination will have strong immunity against diseases as a result of the active white blood cells.
